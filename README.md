# Basicfamily Tutorial

This tutorial explains how to use Eclipse Sirius to create graphical editors for visually describing a family.
It is composed of five parts, from the definition of the domain model to the deployment to end-users via an updatesite,
including the creation of advanced editors and tools (ports, compartments, tables, etc.).<br />

<b>1. Domain Model Tutorial</b> <br>
